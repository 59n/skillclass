Download every skillshare class you want. (thanks to HeckerNoHecking's api)


## Features

- File Names encoded so you can download them without any errors
- Easy to use
- No manual clicks needed.


## Deployment

First install python 3+, then run this command before running the main script :

```


## FAQ

#### How does it work

Basically, HeckerNoHecking's allows us to get the JSON data with the titles and url of any skillshare course. So this tool automates the download of each file, so you can watch all your course for free !

#### Can i delete the "Downloaded" folder

No, not at the moment, unless u "mod" it to your convenience, i made this little project and i will update it soon. DO not hesitate to notify me on the thread on what i could do, or commit changes to the code and upload them to me. thanks !



## Roadmap

- More "flexibility" over the link

- Multi-threaded download (faster with a better internet)

- Coded cleanup and maybe OOP but idk why, it's just for fun ig
