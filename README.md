## FAQ

#### How does it work

Basically, HeckerNoHecking's allows us to get the JSON data with the titles and url of any skillshare courses. So this tool automates the download of each file, so you can watch all your courses for free !

## Roadmap

- More "flexibility" over the link

- Multi-threaded downloads (faster with a better internet)

- Code cleanup and maybe OOP but idk why, it's just for fun i guess.
